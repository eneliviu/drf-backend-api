## Overview

**Project Inspiration**
This backend API project builds upon the knowledge and skills acquired during the development of "LovinEscapades" Django web application completed as part of Milestone Project 4 at Code Institute ([more here](https://github.com/eneliviu/LovinEscapades.git)).

The application envisioned utilizes a full-stack development approach, leveraging:

* Backend: Python with the Django framework
* Frontend: Technologies like Javascript and CSS (specific libraries to be determined)

LovinEscapades aims to empower users to manage their travel experiences through features like:

* User Authentication: Secure login and user management.
* Trip Management: Create, update, and manage trip details.
* Image Management: Upload, store, and associate images with trips.
* Trip Sharing: Share trip information and images with others (public or private).
* Social Features: Potential future functionalities like user interaction and testimonials.

**Public Access**:

* Trip Exploration: Unregistered users might be able to view public trip locations on a map.
* Content Discovery: Access to shared trip details and images (depending on privacy settings).

**Future Considerations**:

* User-friendly interface for a seamless user experience.
* Integration with mapping libraries for interactive trip visualization.
* Potential social features for user interaction and community building.

**Disclaimer**:

This API serves as a backend foundation for a potential application. The envisioned features and functionalities are subject to change and refinement based on further development and user feedback.


## Application development (DONE)
This application was developed using an iterative approach, following Agile principles.

**User Stories & Epics**

We employed a user-centric approach, defining key epics and user stories to guide development.

**Example Epic**:
Epic: As an API developer,
I want to implement robust and secure user authentication,
so that API consumers can securely access and interact with protected resources.

**Example User Story**:

As an API consumer,
I can authenticate with the API using JWT (JSON Web Tokens),
So that I can access protected resources and perform authorized actions.

**Key Epics**:

* User Authentication: Implement secure and reliable user authentication.
* Trip Management: Enable users to create, manage, and share trip plans.
* Social Interaction: Allow users to interact with other users and their content (e.g., liking posts, following users).
* API Documentation: Provide comprehensive and user-friendly API documentation.


All critical user stories identified as "must-have" were successfully implemented within the project timeline.

This project builds upon the "LovinEscapades" project from Milestone Project 4 at Code Institute. It provides an opportunity to apply API development concepts and enhance my understanding of backend development principles. During development, I focused on code quality and maintainability, adhering to the DRY principle and utilizing frequent Git commits for effective version control.

## Project structure

### ***Lovingescapades*** project consists of four apps:

### 1. `trip`
This app features the `Dashboard` page, allowing users to:
- View updated counts of trips, uploaded photos, and testimonials awaiting approval.
- Decide if new trip information will be shared publicly or kept private. Public trips are mapped on the landing page, while private trips are visible only to the authenticated user.
- Quickly access trip details through trip card elements, which provide basic trip information (destination, start and end dates, creation date) along with options to edit/delete trips and upload/delete photos.
- Display approved user testimonials on the landing page and map the locations of shared trips.

### 2. `user_profile`
The user profile app offers two primary sections:
- Profile update section for editing basic user information such as username, first and last name, and email address.
- Functionality for posting and deleting testimonials, which are subject to admin approval before appearing on the landing page.

### 3. `contact`
This app provides essential functionality for site visitors to send inquiries to the site admin via a dedicated form.

### 4. `gallery`
- Hosts the photo gallery where all publicly shared photos by registered users can be viewed by any visitor.
- Users can publish photos even if they choose not to make the associated trip information public.
- Each photo in the gallery includes a like icon and basic trip details, though the feature for sending and receiving likes has not been implemented yet.

## Technologies Used

### **Django Rest Framework:**
- A web framework made with Python that helps build web apps quickly and efficiently. It's great for managing databases and organizing code, making it easier to create complex features for ***LovinEscapades-api***.

### **Geopy Python Module:**
- A library that helps find geographic coordinates, like latitude and longitude, from place names. Itâ€™s used to show trip locations accurately on the map.

### **Django graph models:**
- [Django Extensions](https://shorturl.at/GxkSs) is a collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework that can be used for creating ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams for the project database. These diagrams make it easier to visualize, understand, and manage the database structure. You can view these database model relationships using the online [GraphViz generator](https://shorturl.at/AAuhy).

### **Python modules**
The following Python modules were installed using the `pip install` command in the terminal and were listed in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file.

### **Markdown**
* The Markdown formatting for README.md and HELP.md files was done according to the documentation provided at
[www.markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Cloudinary serving
This project utilizes Cloudinary for efficient and secure image storage and delivery.

### Cloud deployment
* The app is currently deployed on [Heroku Cloud Application Platform](https://www.heroku.com)
* For cloud deployment, the [dependency requirements file](requirements.txt) was compiled using the following command:
```
pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

* The processes to run on the Heroku platform are specified in the `Procfile` file.
* Sensitive information is stored in the `env.py` file, which is listed in the `.gitignore` to prevent it from being uploaded to GitHub.
* The app can be accessed at [***LovinEscapades-api***](https://github.com/eneliviu/drf-backend-api.git).

### Local deployment
* For development or deployment on a local development, the web server can be started using the terminal command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Accessibility and Design

### Accessibility
- Attention was given to the ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) content, ensuring that screen readers can effectively retrieve information when needed.

### Fonts
- The font 'Lato' was chosen for the logo and related statement text. It is both legible and adds a rough, gritty   texture, breaking the clean visual of the site.
- The font 'Roboto' was used for general text, both offering a clean and easily readable appearance.

### Colors and Themes
- The websiteâ€™s style is minimalistic, primarily based on predefined Bootstrap 5.3 themes and touches of custom CSS. This approach ensures good contrast and a decent aesthetic, supporting accessibility and visual appeal.

### Icons
- Font Awesome were used for the Logo, social media icons in the Footer, `My profile`-page link and like buttons on share photos in the `Gallery`-page.

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Responsive design: tablet and mobile phone*.<br>


### User Dashboard
- The Dashboard offers CRUD fuctionality for managing trips and images

![Main menu](static/clips/Dashboard_clean.webp#center)
*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Dashboard page*.<br>

#### **Create new trip**
- On the Dashboard, the stats are null and the user can create a new trip record by clicking on the 'Add new trip' button to open an empty form in a Bootstrap modal.
- By design, all form fields are required

![Main menu](static/clips/Add_new_trip_start.webp#center)
*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>:Add new trip form*.<br>

- Using Javascript, the date picker entries are corroborated in real-time to the Trip status category (Completed, On-going and Planned) to avoid erroneous choices and to increase the UX. The eventual error are shown in browser alerrs, and the user can chose other entries accordingly. 
- On the backend, the date entries are checked against those form other planned trips to eliminate possible collusions. There errors are hadled by Python logic in `trip.views.py`, and a Django error message is sent if necessary.

![Main menu](static/clips/Add_new_trip_success.webp#center)

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Add new trip form: correct date choice for ON-GOING trips*.<br>

- The created trip, if the shared choice is `YES`, it will be sent to the Leaflet map on the landing page. By clicking on the marker, trip information and a redirecting link appear in a tooltip while the map zooms in at the marker location
- The coordinates are calculated using the `geopy` Python module that uses the trip destination (Place and Country) to localize and retrieve the Longitude and the Latitude for mapping the location.
- Although the form does not show the coordinates fields when creating a new trip, these fields exist and are populated when the coordinates are saved.  
- If the location cannot be geolocated, a Django error message is sent to the user.

### Jigsaw CSS Validator

The Jigsaw CSS Validator reported no errors for the custom CSS.

![Main menu](static/docs/W3C-CSS-CustomCSS.webp#center)

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Jigsaw CSS Validator test for custom style*.<br>

However, it identified two errors in the Leaflet CSS, both related to Leaflet specifically:

![Main menu](static/docs/W3C-CSS-Errors-URL.webp#center)

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Jigsaw CSS Validator test errors*.<br>

Upon further investigation using [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com), it was confirmed that `plus-lighter` is a valid value for the `mix-blend-mode` property.

![Main menu](static/docs/CANIUSE_plus-lighter.webp#center)

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.<br>

For the second error, no relevant results were found, and I am unable to provide an explanation or a fix.

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: Lighthouse snapshot test*.<br>


### Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE) 

The WAVE Tool reports no errors but does issue an alert.

![Main menu](static/docs/WAVE_test.webp#center)

*<font color="red">LovinEscapades</font>: WAVE accessibility test*.<br>


Upon investigating further, it suggests that both the site logo and the "Home" navbar element have the same link pointing to the homepage. I have not addressed this alert because having multiple links leading to the home page is a common practice and does not typically impede navigation or accessibility.

![Main menu](static/docs/WAVE_test_alert.webp#center)

### W3C Markup Validation Service

The W3C HTML Validator displays parsing errors because of the Django Template Language. Attempting to find alternative validators online didn't yield any viable solutions. I'm open to suggestions on how to address this issue.

## Manual Testing

- Manual testing primarily concentrated on interacting with the forms to ensure users received appropriate feedback after submission. 
- The default `clean()` and `save()` methods of the model form class were overridden as necessary to implement specific validations.

- Emphasis was placed on real-time user feedback during form completion.
- Fields were designed to provide immediate alerts for incorrect inputs.
- Some form fields were configured with predefined choices to minimize input errors.

- Despite these measures, certain errors might still occur, such as:
    - Selecting inappropriate trip dates that don't align with the trip status, like planning a trip with past dates.
    - Overlapping dates when creating a new trip that conflict with previously created trips.

### Unit Testing

I  run automatic testing for the simplest case - i.e. the ContactForm `contact` app with the command

```
python3 manage.py test contact
```

and I got the following error:
`django.db.utils.OperationalError: near "None": syntax error`

The error occured when running unit testing with all apps, and I have tried to redo the database migrations, but it didn't work. 
For the time being, I am open for suggestions.


### Additional testing

#### Devices and browsers
Additional testing was performed by calling the application from my private devices operating on Windows 11 (desktop and laptop), as well as
on my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S21) operating on Android OS, using the following web browsers:
- Google Chrome: Version 129.0.6668.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- Brave: version 1.70.126 Chromium: 125.0.6422.112 (Official Build) (64-bit)
- Microsoft Edge: Version 129.0.2792.89 (Official build) (64-bit)

## <font color="red">Known bugs and issues</font>
- There is a **Javascript error** that occurs when creating trips with the `Ongoing` status. I don't know if it is a logical error or a coding error, but I suspect that the inclusion of the javascript tags onto the Django templates may not be quite right.
- Mapping remote, exotic or uncharted locations can fail sometimes due to the limitations of the gelocation services
- The geolocator cannot deal with places having similar names, so a more sophisticated logic must be implemented for selecting the right one.

If you encounter other bugs, please create an issue by clicking [here](https://github.com/eneliviu/LovePlanningCLI/issues).

## Further improvements
- Refactor the Javascript functions
- Refactor the delete functions since there is quite a bit of overlap between them.
- Functionality to reply to user inquiries send through the form on the Contact Us page
- Filter and sort options to organize and view the trips and photos according to more detailed criteria.
    - Add a day-time picker to improve the map filter
    - Add separate filter for the image gallery page
    - Add separate filter for dashboard page
- Reminders
    - Set due dates with automatic reminder to receive timely notifications for upcoming trips and deadlines.
- Social Sharing:
    - Share trip experiences and images with other users and visitors.
    - Comment and interact on shared trip entries.
